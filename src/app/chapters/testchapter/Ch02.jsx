				Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
				had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
				wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid
				she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner.
				Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly
				addressed her with:
			</p>
			<p>“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</p>
			<p>
				“We are not in a way to know <i>what</i> Mr. Bingley likes,” said her
				mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
				assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of
				her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of
				her.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not
				depend on her serving you.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself,
				began scolding one of her daughters.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little
				compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them
				ill.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is
				your next ball to be, Lizzy?”
			</p>
			<p>“To-morrow fortnight.”</p>
			<p>
				“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till
				the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she
				will not know him herself.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
				Mr. Bingley to <i>her</i>.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
				myself; how can you be so teasing?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
				very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
				fortnight. But if <i>we</i> do not venture somebody else will; and after
				all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
				she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
				take it on myself.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
				nonsense!”
			</p>
			<p>
				“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do you
				consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them,
				as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <i>there</i>. What say you,
				Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great
				books and make extracts.”
			</p>
			<p>Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.</p>
			<p>
				“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
				Bingley.”
			</p>
			<p>“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</p>
			<p>
				“I am sorry to hear <i>that</i>; but why did not you tell me that before?
				If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on
				him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot
				escape the acquaintance now.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
				Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
				was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
				while.
			</p>
			<p>
				“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade
				you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an
				acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too,
				that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till
				now.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
				as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was
				shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
				or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant,
				I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your
				sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you <i>are</i> the
				youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I <i>am</i> the
				youngest, I’m the tallest.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return
				Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.
